If you don't have Podfile.lock file and pod update doesn't help, try this:

Go to ios/Pods/Local Podspecs directory in your project
Check every json file to find highest required ios version. Mine was "ios": "10.0" in some of them
Go back to ios/ directory
Open Podfile file
Uncomment # platform :ios, '9.0' and replace 9.0 with version from 2. step, for example 10.0.
# platform :ios, '9.0' > platform :ios, '10.0'
Run pod install and the error should be gone

This worked for me:

flutter clean
delete /ios/Pods
delete /ios/Podfile.lock
flutter pub get
from inside ios folder: pod install Run
