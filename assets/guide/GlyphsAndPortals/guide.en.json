The second way is by talking to traveler NPCs and visiting their graves. You will recognize travelers by their appearance. They are not any of the three main species (Gek, Vy'Keen, Korvax) and they have a glow over their body. You will need to talk to them, complete the first interaction, and then talk to them again. During the second conversation you will need to ask them where they came from. This will cost 100 nanites, but if you're lucky you were giving at least this many during your first interaction with them. Then you need to travel to the location they give you."

So if you locate multiple travelers in the same system they will send you to the same grave. If you talk to a second traveler while you have one active they will not show you to a grave and you will miss out on the extra Glyph. You must complete one at a time and then start the next traveler. They will send you to the same grave but you will be able to unlock an additional Glyph."

You will need either a Gek relic, a Korvax casing, or a Vy'Keen dagger depending on which race is the dominant one in this system. Once you have completed that you will receive a waypoint to the portal."
