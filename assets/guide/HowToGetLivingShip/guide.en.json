It may take a few weeks to get the quicksilver as you need 3200 quicksilver. This will take about a week to do. If you are getting a second living ship then you will need 10,000 nanites. Everyone will need 1 void egg you can get from the quicksilver guy. (See picture) you will also need all 16 glyphs"

When you get to the part where you have to wait for the part to mature if you are on PC you can set the time forward 1 day then back 1 day to skip the day of maturing however console players cannot do that. When you get all the parts then you have to put in the glyphs that are in the description of the void egg to go through the portal when you do you will have a soul container you have to find 3 fallen travelers and suck em up. Then return to home."

You will have to have the void egg in your inventory when you're pulsing around you will then meet an anomaly again and talk then head to the coordina.... oh wait where do you get the different living ships? Well I could tell you but there is so many I just cannot do them all. But on nms pinterest/reddit coordinates exchange people may have the living ship you want. Now as I was saying head to the coordinates you received and feed it 10,000 nanites and voila you now have your second living ship"

However of course you could always get a random ship."

					"content": "Now that you have a living ship how do you work it? It works obviously the same but setup is different. You have living parts so you cannot use reg parts. To get them you have to be in a lifeless system (a system with no lifeforms in Korvax, Gek, and Vykeen). Then pulse for a loooooooong time then you will discover a void egg destroy it you get a upgrade mod for living ships do this for 3 void eggs then make a save and reload it. Check Q Ball Gaming's guide to lean in on doing this. You upgrade the mods by stuffing them with nanites and no slot upgrades. The modules will require different fuel types than regular"
