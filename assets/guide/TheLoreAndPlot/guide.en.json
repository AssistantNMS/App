It is the sub-protocol that monitered the atlas before being attached to the traveler.\n\nThe Anomalies were created by the ATLAS through brain scans of its creator in an attempt to preserve itself and end its loneliness.

According to the Sentinel Pillar, the identity of the Abyss is that of the AI of Korvax Prime, the Home planet of the Korvax, and the core of the first convergence, that was based off the Atlas itself. The planet was destroyed by the Gek, but the AI somehow survived. It is gaining influence across the universe, using the sentinels that defected from the Atlas.
