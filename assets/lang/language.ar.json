  "aboutContent": "Why did I bother to build this? \r\nOne day I was playing No Man's Sky and wanted to plan out what farmable resources I should have at a new base, I thought that it would be easier to download an app from the Play/App Store than pull up the wiki on my second monitor. I found an app and was hit with a pay wall when I tried to look at the recipes for crafted materials, annoyed I decided to make an app that would be free for everyone to use. It was also a great excuse to play a bit with Flutter app development. \r\n\r\nP.S. I also have a blog, Inside my Mind - by Kurt Lourens. I havent been making use of it as much as I could have, but I have some articles😋.\r\n\r\nThis App is not affiliated with Hello Games or No Man's Sky, its subsidiaries, or its parent companies, whose names, logos and products are displayed in this App.",

The Public branch is the version of the game that everyone can play. The Experimental branch contains game files that only people who have signed up to the NMS beta can access and the Internal branch is for Hello Games staff only. When updates come to No Man's Sky, they usually get moved to Internal, then Experimental and finally to the Public branch.\n\nThe Steam News page contains the collection of posts that Hello Games has made on the Steam News section, usually updated less frequently than the News page on the No Man's Sky homepage\n",
