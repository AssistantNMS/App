    "Descriptions": [
      "Pirate crews have been disrupting freighter traffic, an affront to both honest and dishonest merchants alike. The client wishes this disruption ended. Disruptively.",
      "Pirates have been looting autonomous mining facilities and attacking the vessels that arrive to empty the hoppers. They prey on the weak, and the client hopes that eliminating a small number of pirate ships will cause the rest to move to a site of less resistance.",
      "Local scientific facilities are struggling to cope with a wave of pirate attacks. Microscopes have been stolen and titration equipment smashed. The client wishes to conduct an experiment in how many pirates need to die in order to stop the attacks.",
      "The client seeks resolution to a family problem. Specifically, a family member has turned to piracy and brought dishonour upon their good name. Destroy them, and restore the client's standing among decent lifeforms.",
      "The client has benefited from a message from the stars, explaining to them their purpose in life. They are to serve the greater good through a never-ending quest to eliminate pirates. They seek pilots to join their crusade, at least temporarily.",
      "This posting has been made on behalf of the client by their estate. The client was marooned by a gang of pirates and left for dead on a hostile planet. The client is presumed dead, but a repeater was left transmitting details of the fate over local radio channels. They requested their remaining funds to be put up as a bounty upon the heads of those who abandoned them.",
      "The client requests immediate assistance in apprehending a pirate. EMP devices were hidden all over their facility, causing serious damage to their operational capabilities. Denied the means to do so themselves, they ask that all law-abiding pilots come to their aid in pursuit of those responsible.",
      "The client has suffered a great loss at the hands of a pirate gang. Rather than an attack in space, they remotely hijacked the client's trade terminal and used it to divert funds and goods to their own account. The client seeks physical retribution for this virtual crime.",
      "Pirates have kidnapped several employees of the client. They are demanding an extremely high ransom price. The client has decided a show of force is the best way to stop future kidnaps. They are seeking a pilot to find and destroy the pirate vessel, despite the hostages still being on board. The loss of life is unfortunate, but such an approach will demonstrate the client will not tolerate extortion attempts.",
      "The client has a lucrative business taking money on the outcome of space battles. They operate out of a luxury freighter, travelling local space in search of conflicts that their customers can observe and bet on in safety and comfort. Business is booming, but conflict is not. They seek pilots to enter the 'arena' and create entertaining action for their passengers.",
      "The client seeks the destruction of nearby pirates.",
      "The client wishes to eradicate piracy from this system.",
      "The client demands swift retribution against the pirates residing near this station.",
      "The client requires the death of all pirates residing near these worlds.",
      "The client urgently seeks the death of pirate scum.",
      "The client seeks the assassination of a nearby pirate squadron.",
      "The client demands the elimination of the pirates who plague these worlds.",
      "The client hopes for the obliteration of all pirates residing near this station.",
      "The criminals have evaded justice for too long, harassing local freighters with impunity.",
      "The criminals raid installations across this sector, believing that they are above the law.",
      "With every passing day, the criminal threat grows. Something must be done.",
      "The criminals brought this upon themselves the moment they decided to live a life of freedom and thievery.",
      "The criminals deserve no amnesty, no release from their crimes.",
      "The criminals would destroy this entire sector, given the chance.",
      "The criminals have disrupted trade routes in this system for far too long.",
      "The criminals chose death when they chose their way of life.",
      "The client wants this dealt with quickly and discretely. They do not wish for reprisals from any affiliated pirate clans.",
      "The client suggests caution in dealing with this matter. The pirates will stop at nothing to bring your starship down.",
      "The client leaves the method of the pirate's extermination to you. Just ensure that none of them live to tell the tale.",
      "The client thanks you for performing this civic duty. No system should tolerate such illegality.",
      "There are many who will benefit from the completion of this contract. Your reward will be considerable.",
      "The client reminds you not to bargain or engage in any conversation with the pirates. They will do anything to escape justice.",
      "The client will accept both sudden and protracted annihilation of the pirates. They leave the speed to you.",
      "The client is aware that other pirates will eventually seek to move in on this territory, but temporary peace is better than no peace at all."

      "The client wishes to present a gift of substantial value to a loyal partner. The partner has served them faithfully and diligently over many years. They require a trustworthy pilot to source and safely deliver an item of appropriate value.",
      "The client seeks an object from their past, a token that reminds them of days gone by. It represents a significant moment in their childhood, and as such they will pay handsomely for the safe delivery of the item.",
      "The client has heard of an emerging new trend. They seek an item rumoured to be both delicious and full of nutrients. Naturally, such sudden popularity means it is hard to source. They will reward any pilot who can acquire the item in time for them to consume it at their next feast.",
      "The client has been researching alternative methods of power generation. They believe they have made a breakthrough. Their new method generates vast amounts of power, with very few toxic waste products. However, they lack supplies of a key component. They cannot leave their lab, and so seek pilots to collect the item for them.",
      "The client is engaged in advanced consciousness research. They have thrown aside preconceived notions of what makes a mind, in search of a more holistic answer. They believe they have made a breakthrough.\nThey have found a material with properties they believe align with the ability to experience thought. All they need to do to prove the theory is assemble a thinking machine built from this substance. This requires a significant amount of material, and they seek explorers to aid with the gathering process.",
      "The client has identified an opportunity for profit. There is a cut of this windfall available to all who assist in the process. \nThey seek a large number of explorers to deliver items to the same location, so as to depress the price in the local markets. This oversupply will force the competition out of business, allowing the client to enter the market at a later date and exploit the lack of long-term supply.",
      "The client seeks to smooth their relationship with the system authorities. They have come to understand the Commissioner of the local station has a taste for a particular item, and would like to see that they receive it. Of course, they would not be so crass as to deliver it in person. They seek an explorer to act as the intermediary and make the collection on their behalf.",
      "The client curates a monthly selection of goods for the rich and idle. They have become aware of a surge of interest in a particular item, and as such they simply must have it for their latest collection. They will pay above market rates to any explorer who can acquire it for them.",
      "The client has become aware that a rival of theirs is interested in a very specific item. Naturally, they cannot allow them to acquire it. They will reward any explorer who acquires the item ahead of their rival, and prevents them doing whatever it is they want it for.",
      "The client has recently begun a new business. They take ordinary items and help others see the value in them. Primarily, this is accomplished by taking cheap objects and distressing them so they appear to be of historical interest. They seek a new batch of items on which to perform their alchemy.",
      "The client is engaged in speculative research. They have received a large grant, and are looking for ways to spend it. As such, they have designed a series of tests they believe will let them know if an item is in need of further testing. They now seek materials on which they can run this procedure.",
      "The client has misplaced an item of great importance. They seek an urgent replacement, so that no-one need ever know the item was gone.",
      "The client has become aware that a rival operation has acquired an item of great importance. They are not entirely sure why the item is significant, but reason that they must have one too lest they be left behind by the competition.",
      "The client is creating a perpetual motion machine. They have sourced a wide variety of parts and energy sources from across the galaxy, and believe they are only a few components short of finalising their creation. They cannot leave the machine unguarded, and as such seek explorers to source the remaining materials.",
      "The client is seeking to fill a secure lockbox with items representing their people and culture. They believe this will be of great value to future historians. However, none of the client's associates have been willing to give up their own possessions. As such, they seek explorers to collect and deliver samples of their selected items.",
      "The client is a noted collector of valuable items. They have assembled a fine collection, but it is missing its final piece. Until that hole is plugged, the collection is worthless. The client calls on all explorers to aid them in their search for this rarest of goods, and will reward any who help them secure it. Mint specimens only, please.",
      "The client seeks to manipulate local markets. Due to an unfortunate data error, they have purchased ten times the volume of goods as they were expecting. They seek explorers to purchase the same item from trade terminals around local space in an effort to drive the price up, so that they may offload their accidental purchase at a profit.",
      "The client is seeking to destabilise relations between two local criminal factions. Both seek a particular item, and if they cannot find it will assume this is part of a plot by the other. The client wishes a discreet explorer to source the item independently, so that they might prompt a conflict between the two rivals.",
      "The client wishes to get ahead of the competition in a business venture. They have heard rumours that a particular market is about to boom, and wish to have the stock on hand to profit when this happens. They will pay above current rates for any samples delivered to them, generously helping independent pilots by taking on the risk in the transaction.",
      "The client is a highly successful entrepreneur. As such, they are far too busy to source their own goods. Instead, they are offering rewards to any independent pilot who completes and delivers their shopping for them.",

      "The client is seeking resolution to a business deal. The other party has been negotiating hard, and the client hopes this package will remove any further impediment to their transaction. It is important the package is delivered only to the recipient.\n\nThe courier will be supplied with 1x Defence Chit, in case of pirate attack.",
      "The client is conducting sensitive business. The package is a heartfelt thank you to certain parties. It is freely given, in the knowledge that any potential indiscretions have been, or will be, overlooked.\n\nThe courier will be supplied with 1x Defence Chit, in case of pirate attack.",
      "The client simply wishes to pass on some goods to a colleague, nothing more. They have also supplied a message to the effect that the recipient has no need to worry, and that the goods are now untraceable.\n\nThe courier will be supplied with 1x Defence Chit, in case of pirate attack.",
      "The client has an important and busy job so cannot be expected to take care of trivial domestic matters. It is a day for celebrating ones progenitors, and the custom is to give a gift to the one who spawned you. The client wishes this matter taken care of, so that they do not have to think about it.\n\nThe courier will be supplied with 1x Defence Chit, in case of pirate attack.",
      "The client owes an emotional debt to a relation of theirs. They have forgotten to commemorate a date of particular importance. By way of apology, they have ordered an item of particular value to be shipped to the wronged party. Take care not to lose it in transport lest the client end up in further difficulty.\n\nThe courier will be supplied with 1x Defence Chit, in case of pirate attack.",
      "The client has come across a strange item. While it appears ordinary, microbial scans revealed an alarming number of unknown spores. They need the item couriered to a biohazard specialist. Do not attempt to break the seal.\n\nThe courier will be supplied with 1x Defence Chit, in case of pirate attack.",
      "The client wishes to send a message to an associate. There is no written message to accompany the item, and the item itself is of no great significance. However, they feel the delivery of the item to the associate's personal address will make their meaning particularly clear.\n\nThe courier will be supplied with 1x Defence Chit, in case of pirate attack.",
      "The client wishes to declutter. They have accumulated a vast number of doodads that they now wish to dispose of. To destroy them would be wasteful, but to deposit them all in one location would potentially reveal too much personal information. As such, they have selected to disperse their items across both a large number of couriers and recipients.\n\nThe courier will be supplied with 1x Defence Chit, in case of pirate attack.",
      "The client is engaging in a small-scale retail business. They purchase unwanted or underappreciated items and then unite them with buyers more in tune to their value. Their latest shipment is ready to be sent to the appreciative connoisseur who paid for it.\n\nThe courier will be supplied with 1x Defence Chit, in case of pirate attack.",
      "The client has an entirely ordinary shipment and seeks a courier who will neither ask questions nor attract the attention of the authorities.

      "The client is part of a long and complex chain of transactions. To avoid leaving any potentially traceable records, the deal has been conducted free from the exchange of currency. This shipment represents their part of the payment to one of the other parties.\n\nThe courier will be supplied with 1x Defence Chit, in case of pirate attack.",
      "The client is dispatching a regular shipment to one of their most loyal customers. The item is not particularly special, but it is important that the customer feels valued. To this end, they are eschewing bulk delivery methods and seek an experienced personal courier.\n\nThe courier will be supplied with 1x Defence Chit, in case of pirate attack.",
      "The client dispatches a large number of items every day. Their business involves tight profit margins, and even the lightest of tax schemes could wipe out their gains. They find it generally more efficient to employ a discreet courier who just happens to deliver their item while on their ordinary, non-commercial business.\n\nThe courier will be supplied with 1x Defence Chit, in case of pirate attack.",
      "The client is known to local pirates, and a bounty has been put on their head. They need to leave the system without being followed. They have embedded their tracking chip into this item, and require it ferried in the opposite direction to their escape.\n\nThe courier will be supplied with 1x Defence Chit, in case of pirate attack.",
      "The galaxy is home to a large and varied web of regulations. Seemingly innocuous items in one system can be highly illegal elsewhere. Such differentiation creates commercial opportunities. The client wishes such an item delivered, with few questions asked and little attention drawn.\n\nThe courier will be supplied with 1x Defence Chit, in case of pirate attack.",
      "The client wishes to secure a major new customer for their business. The customer wishes to sample the client's goods before committing to a bulk order. The client needs this sample delivered to the customer, and it needs to arrive in top condition.\n\nThe courier will be supplied with 1x Defence Chit, in case of pirate attack.",
      "The client ships weekly packages to consumers who are unable or unwilling to shop for themselves. The consumer can then follow the included recipe to prepare themselves a delicious meal and/or robot servant. This shipment represents this week's order.\n\nThe courier will be supplied with 1x Defence Chit, in case of pirate attack.",
      "The client has previously engaged a courier for this shipment, but they proved unable to complete the delivery. Both their Pulse Engine and cockpit canopy suffered a laser-induced mechanical failure. The client seeks a bold new courier, able to out run any other mechanical failures that may be lurking outside the space station.\n\nThe courier will be supplied with 1x Defence Chit, in case of pirate attack.",

      "The intended recipient is of significant importance to the client, and the item must be delivered safely.",
      "The item may appear ordinary, but its list of previous owners and uses makes it of great cultural significance.",
      "The item has developed unusual properties, with readings far beyond expected parameters. It is now of special scientific interest.",

The seek explorers to draw out and engage such higher Sentinels in order that they might be observed in battle.",
      "The client is engaged in advanced artificial intelligence research. They seek to further their studies through the acquisition of mechanical and fabricated brains from across the galaxy. They have a wide collection already, but the jewel in the crown would be the processing unit from an advanced Sentinel. They seek an explorer to make the kill so that their team can safely perform the extraction.",
      "The client requires spare parts for a personal project. Long ago, they overwrote the brain of a damaged Sentinel quadruped with a simple AI of their own creation. This salvaged machine has proved to be a loyal companion. However, various bearings and hydraulic systems are beginning to wear out. They require an explorer to disable or destroy an advanced Sentinel, so that they might harvest it for spares parts and restore their pet to full working order.",
      "The client suffered a great humiliation at the hands of the Sentinels. Their thirst for vengeance has not been slaked by the destruction of Sentinels with their own hands. Nor has the widespread elimination of drones soothed their rage. In what is probably a futile escalation, they are paying explorers to destroy every advanced Sentinel they can.",
      "The client wishes to perform an aggressive experiment. They wish to discover effective ways of discouraging Sentinel drone aggression. Their latest theory is that destroying the more advanced Sentinel creations will leave the drones leaderless and confused, scattering them and bringing respite to planetary explorers. All they require to test this theory is a bold technician to perform the combat portion of their experiment.",
      "The client wishes to probe the systems that drive the Sentinels. Current knowledge is limited to the observation that Sentinels are provoked by the harvesting of resources. They wish to study other behavioural patterns. How do they communicate? Do they have a natural hierarchy? Are they aware of their wounds? How do they feel about their targets? The client feels the best way to answer these questions is to have a suitably equipped explorer engaged an advanced Sentinel while they observe from a safe distance.",
      "The client, like many others, has observed the value of gravitino orbs. Unlike many others, however, they have little desire to be attacked and pursued by Sentinels. Instead, for a share of the profits, they seek an enterprising explorer to attack and kill advanced Sentinel forces. While the drones are distracted, they will quickly collect their orbs and flee before the Sentinels return.",
      "The client has worked hard to grow a substantial nursery garden, full of rare and valuable plants. However, this has attracted thieves and other plant plunderers. The client seeks to construct their own private Sentinel force to monitor their trees. The have a large number of parts from downed drones, but to complete their patrol group they need pieces from a Sentinel quad or walker. They seek an explorer to perform the necessary combat manoeuvres.",
      "The client is testing a potential solution to the Sentinel harassment problem. They have developed a device that broadcasts high-frequency sounds at a wavelength that interferes with whatever intelligence drives the Sentinels. At least, that is the theory. The client seeks an explorer to engage an advanced Sentinel in battle, so that the device can be tested properly. The explorer should be prepared to fight if the device fails to function correctly.",
      "The client has developed a networking device that operates at the same wavelength as the Sentinel communicator systems.
