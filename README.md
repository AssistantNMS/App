Almost all of the data is extracted from the **No Man's Sky** game files. This project would not be possible without the hard work of the NMS Modding community and the [MBinCompiler][mbincompiler].

> This app was originally released in early August 2019! The app was originally named No Man's Sky Recipes, when submitting the app to the Apple Store it was rejected due to the name and so the app was renamed.

__The iOS build on [CodeMagic][codeMagic] generally reports that it has failed even though it actually successfully built and pushed the `.ipa` file to the Apple App Store. This is because they poll the App Store checking if the `.ipa` file is there and after a few attempts throw an error. So ignore build failures for anything that has to do with iOS ðŸ™„.__
