# Security Policy

We take security issues seriously, we will do our best to address any vulnerabilities as quickly as possible. 
We also welcome the disclosure of any vulnerabilities found through a [Github issue](https://github.com/AssistantNMS/General/issues/new) or via an [email to support@nmsassistant.com](support@nmsassistant.com)

## Supported Versions

We try to make a reasonable effort to support older versions of AssistantNMS, 
but the truth is that technology is always moving forward trying to resolve the 
latest exploits and vulnerabilities

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security vulnerabilities should be sent to [support@nmsassistant.com](support@nmsassistant.com). You can typically expect a 
response within two business days, and we typically have fixes out in under a week from the initial disclosure (depending on how quickly the App Stores approve updates).

### Personal Identifiable Information
We try our best to avoid storing any Personal Identifiable Information (PII). We will never ask for your password or even store any password in any form
